# Landing-Page-TOP

This is my project for the TOP (The Odin Project) Foundations Course.

The design is as of yet unfinished and will require some tweaks (specially that atrocious color scheme), but this should be the general look and feel of the page.

Todo:

1. Change the color scheme to something more interesting.
2. Adjut the layour of the bottom parts to fit within the top.
3. Give some variety to the images and illustration.
4. Write lesss generic text.
5. Add some destinations to the links.
6. Posssibly add some interactivity to the page with some javascript.
